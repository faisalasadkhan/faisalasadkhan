## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a BBAICT graduate with a strong foundation in business and information technology, supported by an Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming (Java & C++) and Oracle 8i certification.

My technical background includes C++, Java, SQL, database design, and data analytics. Professionally, I have worked as a Data Analyst and CRM Coordinator at Bell, where I utilized SQL, Tableau, and CRM systems to analyze data, optimize reporting processes, and support data-driven decision-making.

I am particularly interested in IoT systems, cloud infrastructure, and scalable data-driven solutions. I enjoy building modular applications that connect devices, manage data efficiently, and transform raw information into actionable insights.

Currently seeking opportunities to grow in IoT, cloud, and backend-focused roles where I can apply my programming and database expertise while expanding hands-on experience in modern system design.
